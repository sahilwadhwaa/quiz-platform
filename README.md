# React Quiz Platform
A dynamic and user-friendly quiz platform built with React.js, Redux Toolkit and MUI Framework that allows users to create and play their own quizzes. Features include a sleek and responsive design, real-time quiz creation, and an intuitive and interactive user interface. The platform also includes an admin panel that allows for easy management of quizzes. This project showcases my skills in React.js, Redux Toolkit, JavaScript, and web development, and is a great example of my ability to build interactive and engaging web applications.
